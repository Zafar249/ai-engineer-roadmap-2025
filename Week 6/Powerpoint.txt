1. Use only one message per slide

2. Use PowerPoint as it is supposed to be: short text with an image.
Due to the redundancy effect, a human brain will process zero information simultaneously trying to read 
and hear at the same time. Avoid using long sentences in a powerpoint.

3. The most important part of the PowerPoint should be the biggest to draw attention to it.

4. Improve your contrast to bring focus to it. Brighten the important words and darken the rest. 
Use a black background too focus attention on yourself during a presentation

5. Use six objects in a Powerpoint. Don't use 7 objects or more as it requires 500% more cognitive
brain resources and memory.

The number of slides in a powerpoint doesn't matter. It is the number of objects used per slide ia a 
powerpoint that matters.
