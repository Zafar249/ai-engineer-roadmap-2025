Head is a reference to the most recent commit in the current,active, branch (in most cases).

When Head doesn't point to the most recent commit, you go into detached Head state. 

Inorder to show the Head commit:
git show HEAD

Inorder to show a commit:
git show {commit id}

Inorder to show difference between two commits:
git difftool {older commit id} {newer commit id}

Inorder to show a commit n commits from the Head:
git show HEAD~n

e.g: To show a commit 1 commit from the HEAD:
git show HEAD~1

Inorder to go into detached Head state:
git checkout {older commit id}

note: Inorder to return to normal Head state:
git checkout main
