Version control, also known as source control, is a method of tracking and managing changes made to files
over time.

Git is a distributed version control system. In Git there are many local repositeries which are 
synced with remote repositeries. Every developed has a copy of that repository on their machine.
There is no central server which stores only one repository 

github has three benefits over storing files locally:
1. Code is stored on cloud and synced locally
2. If multiple people are working on the same code, they can work on their own computers using code from
   the cloud and push changes using merge tools
3. VCS mantains version history so it is possible to revert to a previous version of a code anytime
   you want.
