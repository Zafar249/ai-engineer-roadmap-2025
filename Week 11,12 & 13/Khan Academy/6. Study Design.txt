Simple Random Sample is a completely random sample of the population
In Startified Random Sample, the population is divided into multiple categories. A random sample is taken
from each category.
In Clustered Random Sample, the population is divided into clusters. A random sample is taken from a 
cluster.
In Systematic Random Sample, a random sample is chosen and nth samples after the random sample are 
counted.

In a Sample Study you study a small sample of the population to learn about a parameter

In an Observational Study, you study how two parameter's correlates

In an Experiment you try to prove causality.

Explanatory variables explain changes in other variables
 
Response variables measure the result of a study

In a blind experiment the people in the sample don't know which group they are in
In a double-blind experiment, the people and the physicians don't know which group they are in.

A confounder variable affects both the dependent and the independent variable

In a comparative experiment, the researcher measures the effects of different conditions on a single 
variable.

In a block design, people are split into groups(men and women). Samples are then taken from each 
individual group.

In a matched pair design people are grouped into pairs based on similar characteristics before being
split into control and experiment groups.
