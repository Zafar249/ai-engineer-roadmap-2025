A sample proportion is the ratio of a subset of elements with a particular characteristic compared to the
total number of elements in the sample.

The mean of a sample proportion over a sampling distribution is P

The standard deviation of a sample proportion over a sampling distribution is (pq/n) ** 1/2

Sample size is the number of samples in a sample set.

The central limit theorem states that as the sample size approaches infinity,
the sampling distribution of the mean approaches normal distribution

If we take the mean of a bunch of actions and plot the frequency of those means,
we approach the normal distribution

skew tells how skewed from the mean a normal distribution is. Positive is rightly skewed and negative
id left skewed

kurtosis indicates the standard deviation from the mean. Positive kurtosis means peak is more taller
but base is less wide. Negative kurtosis means peak is lower but base is wider.

The variance of your sampling distribution of the mean is variance of original data / n
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean is also called the standard error 
of the mean
