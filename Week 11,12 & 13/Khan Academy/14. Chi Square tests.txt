Chi-Square Distribution is the distribution of a sum of the squares of independent random normal 
variables.

Q = X1 ** 2 + X2 ** 2

Q ~ X2(chi) ** 2

The degree of freedom is equal to the number of the independent random normal variables used to calculate
Q. For n data points, the degree of freedom is n-1

The higher the degree of freedom, the more symmetric the distribution gets, as the peak moves lower and
to the right.

The chi-square distribution is always positive.

The chi-square statistic is calculated by adding up the square of the normalised variables.

In order to normalise: (Expected-Observed)  ** 2 / Expected

Pearson's chi-square test says that if the chi-square statistic is greater than the critical chi-square
value, we reject the null hypothesis.

A contingency table is a type of table in matrix format that displays the multivariate frequency
distribution of the variables.

The degree if a freedom for a contingency freedom is: df = (row-1)(col-1)

Homoginiety is similarity between two tables

The expected values for two variables which are associated is the product of row percent * col percent
* total
