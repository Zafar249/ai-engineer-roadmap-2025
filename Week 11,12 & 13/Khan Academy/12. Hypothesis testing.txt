The null hypothesis states that there is no difference  between two groups being compared

The alternative hypothesis states that there is a significant difference between two groups being
compared.

significance level(alhpa) represents the threshold at which the null hypothesis is disproven or the 
alternative hypothesis is proven

p-value is the statistic that the sample mean is greater than the mean given that the null hypothesis
is true.

if our p-value is less than the significance level we reject the null hypothesis

Type 1 Error is if our null hypothesis is true but we reject it. The probability of a tpye 1 error is
the significance level

Type 2 Error is if our null hypothesis is false but we fail to reject it.

Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false

Alternatvely Power is 1 - the probability of a type 2 error
