10% rule: If the sample is less than or equal to 10% of the population it can be assumed to be
approximately independent.

Law of Large Numbers:
The mean of a set of numbers approaches the expected values of x, as n approaches infinity.     
For flipping a coin, the mean of a number of trials approaches 0.5, as n approaches infinity.   

For Poission Distribution: P(X=k) = (lambda/k!) * e ** lambda

A bernoulli random variable can only take two possible values, representing a success and a failure.
