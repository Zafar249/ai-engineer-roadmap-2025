A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population 
parameter.

A margin of error expresses the amount of random sampling error in a survey's result.

The critical value z* is the number of standard deviations we want to go above or below our mean value.

If we don't know the actual standard deviation of our population mean, we can use the t-statistic:
mean of x +- t* (sample standard deviation/(n ** 1/2))

Degree of freedom is sample size - 1

The tail probability is half of 1 - the confidence interval

A sampling distribution has fatter tails because we are underestimating the standard deviation.
