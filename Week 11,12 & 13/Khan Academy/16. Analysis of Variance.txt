SST is the total sum of squares. It is calculated by subtracting the value from the mean of the entire
dataset and squaring the result.

Each result is summed up and divided by the degree of freedoms (row * col - 1)

SSW is the total sum of squares within a group. It is calculated by subtracting the value from the mean
of the group and squaring the result.

Each result is summed up and divided by the degree of freedom (row * (col - 1))

SSB is the total sum of squares between each group. It is calculated by subtracting the mean of the group
from the mean of the entire dataset and squaring the result. 

Each result is repeated for each value in a group for each group and divided by the degree of 
freedom: (row - 1)

Degree of freedom of SSB + Degree of freedom of SSW = Degree of freedom of SST

The total variance of the dataset is equal to the sum of the variance of means within a group and 
between a group

F-statistic is the ratio of two chi-squared distributions that have different degrees of freedoms.

F-statistic = (SSB / degree of freedom)/(SSW / degree of freedom)

If it is greater than 1, we reject the null hypothesis, as the variance between the groups is
greater than the variance within a group
