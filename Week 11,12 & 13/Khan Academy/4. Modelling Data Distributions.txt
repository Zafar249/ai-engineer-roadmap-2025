z-score: how many standard deviations is a value from the mean
Alternatively, standardize the value

Empirical rule: Within one standard deviation of the mean the total area is 68%, within two 95%
and within three 99.7%

The formula of normal distribution is: p(x) = 1/ [(2*pi*(sigma**2) * (e ** z) ) ** 1/2]
where z is the z-score.
