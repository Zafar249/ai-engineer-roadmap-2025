Inferences can be made about the true population regression line by using the sample population
regression line and estimating a confidence interval.

Using the slope of the sample regression line y=a+bx

b +- t* SE[b] (standard error or standard deviation of sample / (n ** 1/2))

A null hypothesis can state that the slope of the population regression line is 0
meaning there is no non-zero linear relationship between the two variables.

Conditions for Inference are:
Linear- There is a linear relationship between the two variables.
Independence- Sampling with replacement or the sample is 10% of the population
Normal- For any value of x, the distribution of the values of y should be normal.
Equal Variance- Each distribution of y should have the same variances
Random

Degree of freedom is equal to number of data points - 2
