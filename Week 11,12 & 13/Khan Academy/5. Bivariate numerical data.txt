Correlation Coefficient meausres the correlation of a linear relationship:

Formula of correlation oefficient: r= (1/n-1) * sum of [(z-score of x[i])(z-score of y[i])]

Linear Regression is using a line to summarize a relationship and make predicitons about the data

Residual is the difference in height between the actual point and the point predicted by the line.

Least square regression minimizes the sum of the squares of the residual by changing the values of 
gradient and y-intercept.

minimize(sum of(r[n] ** 2)) by changing m and b

m = r(s.d of y / s.d of x)
b can be calculated using the point (mean of x, mean of y)

Total Squared Error: sum of (y[i] - (mx[i] + b))

Coefficient of determination: r**2 = 1 - (squared error of line / squared error of mean of y)
What % of the total variance in y is described by the variation in x

Root-mean-square error/ Standard deviation of residuals = (sum of square of residuals / n-1) ** 1/2

covariance of (x,y) = mean of [(x - mean of x)(y - mean of y)]
Sign tells the direction y takes when x goes up and Magnitude tells the degree that y takes.

gradient of regression line = Cov(X,Y) / Cov(X,X) i.e Var(X)
