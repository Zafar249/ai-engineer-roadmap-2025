# Static Arrays have a fixed capacity which is declared at compiletime.
# The Array's capacity cannot be changed once the program has begun running.

# Dynamic Arrays can allocate memory to an array as needed.
# They do this by instantiating a new array with increased capacity.
# All elements of the previous array are shifted to the new array with time complexity O(n).
