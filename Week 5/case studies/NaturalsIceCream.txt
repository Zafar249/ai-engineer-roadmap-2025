1.
Problem: Kamil Wanted to sell Ice cream, an unfamiliar dessert in India at the time
Solution: Anchor Innovate Adoption Model: To introduce Ice cream(an unfamiliar product) naturals first
launched it alongside familiar desserts(anchors) using existing customer trust to derive adoption
Outcome: Customers began to learn about and enjoy Ice cream, growing their reputation and customer base.
By the end of the 1st weekend, over 1000 cups were sold.

2. Problem: Competition with International and Local Brands who had much more funding, 
distribution(threat) capability and recognition. 
Solution: Kamil recognised that by mass producing ice creams, fresh fruits and milk fat would not be used
as they would require a long shelf life(>14 days) and would be too expensive.
So Nautrals freshness would be a strength
There is no need to undercut your price, do everything your competitor does and be wherever he is.

3. Problem: How do you expand the business without losing what makes your product unique?
Solution: Keep core flavours for nostalgia and introduce time-limited new flavours
for special occasions. Loyalty of Customer is most important.
Outcome: Naturals has over 150 ice creams brands in India Today.

4. You don't need to scale fast you need to scale right(Naturals expanded slowly city by city)

5. Protect your edge(differentiation) even if it screws you down
(Naturals never sacrificed freshness for convinience)

6. Your back end should be as good as your friend end(for each flavour there were data and logistics
behind it. Naturals tracked flavour demand using sale data and adjusted milk and fruit procurement
daily to minimize demand(cost leadership))

Tips for future case studies:
Give Introduction
Add data like market share and customer retention rates
Compare Stratergies with competitors
Lessons for AI engineers: Just like naturals uses data for flavour logistics, AI engineers can optimize
supply chains with predictive analysis
